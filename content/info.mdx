## Vision

Multiverse is a place for cool people to do cool things - people from all different backgrounds, ages and walks of life will come together to create a positive collective experience. Our vision is to involve more and more people in this movement, building new connections, sharing ideas and wisdom, displaying creative endeavors and providing social enrichment. We encourage you to think about how you can improve the festival experience for yourselves and others.

## Location

After 3 iterations, Multiverse has outgrown its original home in the southern pine forests, and will move to the beautiful site of Redbanks. Located in Nugent, less than one hour from Hobart, this idyllic spot enjoys the shade of beautiful eucalypts, and features sprawling fields for camping (with a creek adjoining the campsite).

Some of you may already be familiar with the site, as Redbanks was recently the site for the Great Escape Festival over NYE, and there have been several events here in the past. The site is easy to find, using either [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/78RhwLM2BN5VEUGD9) (or just following the road signs), and the road in is excellent, suitable for all types of vehicles.

We are excited at the opportunities this site presents, and we can't wait to show you what we have planned. So join us at Redbanks from 25 January as we transcend beyond the physical Universe, and experience the Multiverse.

## Camping

Please stick to the designated camping area. You can bring your own food and drinks, but only for personal use, not for sale. Gas Cookers are permitted for outdoor use. Do not use gas cookers in your tent! If fire safety conditions change and this policy changes, you will be informed upon entry to the festival. There should be ample space for all attendees, but please do not use more than you require.

## Festival Guidelines

## Cash/EFTPOS

Some of our food vendors will have Card/EFTPOS facilities on site, but they will be using a Starlink satellite connection. Drop-outs are expected, so please also bring cash.

## Road Safety

Road safety is a big priority so make sure you drive safely on the way to and from the festival. Make sure you have slept enough before doing the drive. Do not drive under the influence of alcohol or any other substances.

## Sneak-ins Policy

Unfortunately there are some people who choose to sneak in to the festival to avoid paying or contributing. This is super disrespectful to everyone who does the right thing. Anyone found to be sneaking in will be removed from the Festival site, as will anyone found to be assisting them. For those who have a genuine problem with affording an entry ticket we encourage you to pursue volunteer work opportunities, or to contact the organisers.

## Conditions Of Entry

Management reserves the right to refuse entry & unsociable behaviour will not be tolerated. All cars entering the property may be subject to inspection for compliance with our event policies.
