# Lineup

_Music is at the core of the Multiverse experience! We pride ourselves on careful curation, as we cover a wide range of genres and styles that will satisfy all tastes._

The Main Stage is the beating heart of Multiverse, and is the place to be if you are feeling like a good dance. We move from Techno, Bass, Psy-Trance, to House, with over 72 hours of non-stop music. And the Chill Space is the place to be if you are feeling like a change of pace, with downtempo, chillout and lounge for days.
